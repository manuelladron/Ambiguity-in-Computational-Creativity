# Ambiguity-in-Computational-Creativity

Language is ambiguous; many terms and expressions convey the same idea. Despite advances in multimodal research and natural language processing, subjective reasoning and description remains unresolved. Multimodal machine learning can describe an image of “a girl wearing a red shirt” but is unable to describe or generate a “minimal, elegant and sleek looking chair”.  This is especially challenging in creative practice, where conceptual ideas and design intents are highly subjective. Today, digital design engines require an involved modeling processes performed as a series of procedural imperative commands — move, circle, radius, extrude, vertical, etc. These are coordinated around higher level design intents, expressed in natural language, say, as “the chair should look more minimal, elegant and sleek.” These well-defined commands can be viewed as software’s language translations of designer's’ conceptual ideas into action. Deep learning provides an alternative: the means to learn visual representations of subjective, ambiguous descriptions, such as dynamic, light or minimalist. This would reduce the need for a designer to reinterpret intent into software commands.

Aguessy was born on 17 April 1977 in Lome\u0301 and moved to the USA in 1980 with his family before later settling in the UK and then France. He founded his studio in Paris in 2008, the same year that his Useless Tool chair, manufactured using military aircraft techniques, made an impression as part of an exhibition called Please Do Not Sit, according to the Palais de Lome\u0301. Afterwards, he worked with Coca-Cola on a set of furniture made from recycled materials, helped to set up Benin's first fabrication laboratory with the support of Paris's Centre Pompidou. He also created objects for Togo to present during its presidency of the United Nations Security Council in 2013. His work is held in the permanent collections of the Centre Pompidou and the Museum of Art and Design in New York. The Palais de Lome\u0301 is dedicated to fostering contemporary creative practices in Togo and the region, and has a dedicated design gallery. Its creative team had hoped to collaborate with Aguessy on an exhibition, but after his passing, they chose to inaugurate the institution with a retrospective of his work instead. \", \" said the Palais' director, Sonia Lawson.

It was also added to the permanent collection at New York's Museum of Modern Art. However CFL technology was soon to be superseded by LED, which has jumped from having just 10 per cent market share when   launched to over 80 per cent today. The brand subsequently moved into LED products and accessories such as shades, but production issues, competition from the lighting sector and the rise of \", \" lighting have led to Plumen's decision to seek a buyer that can take the brand forward. Roope and Hemus, an entrepreneur and investor, spoke to Dezeen about the brand's legacy and what happens next.  What would you say you achieved with Plumen? How did you change the industry?  We created a new sector within the lighting industry: designer low energy bulbs. Prior to Plumen, there was no choice in low energy bulb design. The low-energy light bulb wasn't desirable. It was seen as a necessary evil, a compromise. The Plumen 001 changed that. Suddenly, people were talking positively about a compact fluorescent light bulb, it was winning awards and being proudly displayed rather than hidden away. It was a big shift which made the industry take notice. Our success drew other manufacturers into the space and today there is a huge range of design. Innovation is not just technology focussed, it crosses over into the product and the user experience. Many designs still take their cue from the Edison-style bulb (LED filaments allow manufacturers to replicate classic designs) but we see a lot of new innovation coming through. It's hopefully something Plumen can continue to inspire.  Perhaps more importantly, we made consumers think differently about low energy lighting and, hopefully, sustainability as a whole. When we launched, any changes we as consumers were being asked to make to save energy were always seen as a compromise to our lifestyles, whereas now more people are seeing it as an opportunity to raise the bar of product and experience beyond levels seen before. Electric cars for instance are outperforming their fossil-fuel-powered parents and their designs are becoming the most exciting too. What would you have done differently?  A full answer would fill a book. Mistakes are teachers for entrepreneurs, so there are always things you would have done differently. For Plumen, it's important to distinguish things that you could actually have changed versus the things that were simply down to timing and context. It's easy to think that being the creators of a sector gave us a big advantage, but that's rarely the case for first movers and wasn't for us. Firstly, when we launched, we were working with CFL technology, which was unpopular and had serious technical and environmental limitations.  LED was on the horizon, but not commercially viable for what we were trying to do back in 2010. This meant that we had quality issues and the bulbs couldn't dim. These were big restrictions that kept us out of large sections of the market, which made it hard to scale. At the time, light bulb manufacturers were only interested in high volumes and low prices, which meant low quality. Our minimum investment in stock of a new product was in the hundreds of thousands. It limited the number of designs we could launch, and each one had to succeed. Just five years later, in 2015, the situation was completely different. LED technology was ready for market and at an accessible price. Boutique factories, geared to low volumes and high quality, had started to appear and minimum order quantities reduced by 90 per cent. It meant that you could launch new products from high-quality factories using superior technology for a fraction of the price. New entrants took advantage of this while we were locked into supplier agreements that took years to extract ourselves from. However, there were plenty of things we were in control of. Looking back, we should have stayed focussed on the truly unique designs we made our name with, we should have stuck to light bulbs rather than get into making shades and we ought to have focussed sooner on the lighting industry rather than the design industry. All easy in hindsight, but these decisions made sense at the time and there are always issues that cloud your judgement. We moved into more general lighting because we struggled to convince light shade manufacturers to design around our bulbs. We also saw our bulbs as ingredient products, made to work with shades and other accessories, whereas lighting manufacturers saw our products as competition. We tried to get round this by making our own shades and accessories, which was good for revenues but took our focus away from light bulbs. The same thing applied with the rise of Edison-style LED filament bulbs. They became popular and our sales suffered. The natural thing was to sell them too, but it took away focus again and stretched our resources. Do you have any tips for designers who want to launch their own brands rather than designing for other brands?  The big difference would be how little designing you'll be able to do once you launch your own product brand. This is true when you start your own design agency, but is even more so when it comes to your own product company. Once a product is out in the market, it takes on a life of it's own and you have to adapt accordingly. Having a team of people around you who can handle production, logistics, finance, marketing, staff, investors and everything else is essential. There is no escaping that the business will need you to do a lot more than design which, even for a design brand, will be one of the less essential parts of the business. Most likely, you'll end up hiring other designers who you'll direct because you simply won't have the time. Modern businesses have to be able to react fast, work efficiently, be strong in all areas and compete in a marketplace where competitors have often raised large sums of money and can afford to make losses for years. VC money has fundamentally changed the landscape. Excellent, beautifully designed products are no longer enough for a company to survive and you'll need to add a lot of strings to your bow. That is not to say that you shouldn't go for it; far from it. If you're thinking about it, get experience in a similar early-stage business first, learn from the mistakes of others, network, find business partners and the foundations of your core team. Timing and luck are important, but people, organisation and application are more so. Most importantly, do something you are passionate about, that you believe is important and make it about more than just money. On the shit days you'll still have your passion to drive you. Will you and Michael-George leave the brand when you find a new buyer? It depends on who the buyer is, and what their vision is for lighting and for Plumen. New research is constantly coming through to improve our understanding of the effect that light has on our behaviour as individuals and society as a whole. Technology is at a place where it can adapt and react to these discoveries and can put them into powerful effect. When you combine this with the fact that the general public is becoming increasingly aware of the effect of light on their wellbeing, through Night Shift on the iPhone, or f.lux, it means that the conditions are there for a brand with the right vision and approach to make a real impact. However, it remains to be seen what the future holds. Whether we each have a role or not is not yet clear. Will this mean the end of classic products like the Plumen 001?  No, we don't believe so. We will still be manufacturing to order, which means some of the designs will be available through certain retailers and manufacturing partners. If we find a buyer, there is every chance that Plumen could return to selling directly. There is still demand for the 001, sales of which have been growing since the launch of the LED version. Our other unique designs, the 002 and the 003, continue to be in demand, so our gut feeling is that they will continue in some way.  Plumen's current situation is not down to lack of demand for the products but more the difficulties of being a small, independent manufacturer in a volume market, where economies of scale are key. Innovation is expensive, especially as we try to move into smart lighting. Demand for our products is still strong, so we suspect that they will keep on going one way or another.  If you're selling through the stock and looking for a buyer, how does that tally with the brand shifting to smart lighting? We're changing business model and cutting costs to remain viable, but that doesn't stop us having ambitions and a vision for where we would like to get to. We had hoped to realise that vision ourselves, through our own resources, but that's no longer possible. As a result, we're setting out that ambition publicly, presenting it to potential buyers and trying a different route to get there. It is almost like how we started: when we first announced the idea for Plumen in 2007, we had made a design out of neon and a Fairy Liquid bottle, took a few shots and sent out a press release. So it feels the natural thing to do Wouldn't the brand be more valuable to a buyer if you were still producing products? We will still be making the products for the foreseeable future, but only to order for partners that order direct, like Made.com, and certain distributors. But yes, in an ideal world we will still be making for our own warehouses. The simple truth is that we need more time to find a buyer, we need to get to a place beyond Brexit and the US trade wars (a question coming from interested US buyers) where people are more willing to invest and take risks. In order to do this, we've got to cut costs and build more runway, hence the decisions. More importantly, the most valuable thing we are offering is our brand, experience and vision. None are affected by the changes.

A body architect is something fabricated, a made-up name. But it won me a dream job in wearable electronics at Philips. I was put forward for a job where I would lead the company's design research lab. In the interview, the head of resources asked me what kind of designer I was. Medical designer? Fashion designer? Lighting designer? I moved my hands around in the air like I was juggling and said 'none of them'. He said, 'in order to hire you for this job, I need to know who you are'. So I went away and came up with this title 'body architect'. It's a nebulous term that allows me to slip between thought leader, creative director, science-fiction artist and filmmaker. I came back a week later to tell him and, no joke, he flipped the contract across the table. The following Monday I was rolling around in a Lycra sack, developing the kind of inspiration for what would become the Bubelle Dress. What exactly does a body architect do?  The great thing about creating something from scratch, is that you get to define what it means. As a body architect, I can tap into any discipline without limitation. I build worlds object by object to speculate on the future of the body; asking who we are and where we are headed. The worlds are presented via installation, film, photography and set design and address topics like the human condition, psychology, genetic engineering, edible technology or the ethics of artificial intelligence. My philosophy is to ask impossible questions, to disrupt, to swim upstream and to make things I've never made before. Why is the body so central to your work? I started doing classical ballet at the age of four and as I grew older I became much more serious about it. So as a teenager I was doing very high-level ballet competitions, training four days a week. Then, when I wasn't doing ballet, I was running 100-metre hurdles. Both disciplines were about performance and pushing my body's physical limits. Exploring the edges of the human body and proposing ways to optimise our existence, is what continually drives my work. Using my body allows me to go deeper into a concept and play the protagonist to act out worlds. I'm interested in the idea of thinking through making, either as a film director, or as the test dummy when I'm building an installation. Tell about the phrase you use, 'the future is fleshy'. Where did this come from and what does it mean in relation to your work? I was asked to speak at an MIT conference on wearable technology with Christina Agapakis, who is creative director at Gingko Bioworks, a company that customises the microbiome. 'The future is fleshy' was the title of our presentation, which shone a light on the lack of feminine points of view in science and tech. I'm not interested in a future that is associated with science-fiction tropes that are masculine, mechanical, or not reflective of what I think makes us human. I'm interested in things that are messy, visceral and human. This thinking relates to the body, both aesthetically and in how we could experience the world. As an artist, the way that I approach technology is using it like a membrane, an elastic visceral membrane that can be draped, pulled apart, made transparent or mutated. How male-dominated is the world of science, technology and science fiction in your experience, and how is that shaping our visions of the future? Traditionally art, architecture, engineering, science, maths, medicine, construction, law, agriculture... most industries are male-dominated. My goal is to portray females in these roles and summon feminine leadership. When I worked at Philips, I had a really amazing team who were predominantly male. Sometimes I would buy men's deodorant, and I would wear baseball caps and men's trousers, just to get into the headspace and the hormonal output of the rest of my team. I'm interested in giving science fiction an overdue sex change. The art I make speculates on the human condition with narratives that are feminine, raw and laced with emotion, to provoke and steer our future. Tell me about your time at Philips. What kind of things were you working on?  At Philips we used the body as a platform for innovation to question the future of tech and the body. We weren't interested in technologies that were intelligent, we were interested in technologies that were sensitive. We created a series of dresses that blushed and shivered with light, jewellery that sensed hydration and an electronic tattoo that was augmented by touch. These were high-art concepts for a consumer electronics company. We were trying to understand whether people wanted this. Would people implant tech under the skin? Would they wear a dress that senses emotions? The concepts were meant to be disruptive and provocative. Was the series of images you made with Bart Hess an extension of these ideas? The series I made with Bart, in particular the Germination series, explores the concept of humans, plants and animals merging. Could we sprout grass from the pores of skin and become ecological beings? Bart and I met at Philips doing the electronic tattoo. At the time, plastic surgery was becoming a consumer product. So we were having conversations about the future of beauty. What is the future of beauty? If everyone is going to look the same, will this create a mono aesthetic? Will that cause a rebellion of the ugly? The important thing for us was that we made immediate imagery for these conversations. We would do them in a day, we would do them once a week, and it became a sport using various different materials. It would be an experiment and it was really primal. How did you move from these projects to the type of speculative futures things you did next, like Swallowable Parfum?  The very foundation of looking at technology through an artistic lens was what I learned at Philips. It was such an incredible lesson, to see technology as something you could give a story to. After I left, I had four and a half years of experience in wearable tech and I had this project with Bart, but nobody really knew how to use me. Swallowable Parfum was me saying, 'this is what I can do, this is how you can use me'. It was 2011 and at the time the beauty industry was worth $465 billion in the US alone; perfume had never been disrupted. While animals sniff butts to find breeding companions, humans wear deodorant, perfume and take hormone replacement pills that all mask body odour. When we sweat, it's the smell of our immune system oxidizing through our skin. The concept of the pill was to manipulate the immune system to create a biologically enhanced fragrance from the inside out. Could a biologically enhanced fragrance be responsible for disrupting the laws of attraction? Would we choose different partners to breed with? Could the beauty industry be responsible for changing the course of evolution? Do you see your projects as trying to ask questions or answer them? Definitely to ask them. I'm not interested in saying how things will be or how they should be. I want to ask, what if this happened? The aim is to ask impossible questions to provoke the body's relationship with science and create forums for debate. I want the complexity of where we are right now to reach the fringes of culture. We've been submissive to technology \u2013 it drips into our lives and we just adapt. It's important to challenge whether we really want it. What I learned with Swallowable Parfum is that, if you tell plausible stories about the future, people will want these narratives to be real. And that can steer the course of technology. After that it seems like you moved on from beauty into thinking about the relationship between the body and space. Can you tell me about some of those projects? I have to say, the project I did with Dezeen was pivotal. It was the installation I did \u2013 up until that point, I had been making short films. After that, I created the first Future Day Spa at the Ricoh conference in Los Angeles. The Future Day Spa is an immersive art installation offering 360-degree hugs via a machine. When the body is placed in a vacuum, the circulation of blood increases. In the 1960s, NASA used vacuum pressure as a way to prep astronauts for the lack of gravity in space. Like a human hug, this hugging machine triggers the natural release of oxytocin in the brain. This hormone is responsible for building trust and love between people. One of the people I treated at the Future Day Spa suffered from haphephobia, which is the fear of physical contact. I gave him a nine-minute treatment and when he got up out of the bed, he hugged me. It wasn't what I had expected! After learning that someone who feared touch craved for it, I threw my attention into the psychology of isolation. Why would someone essentially silence the release of oxytocin in the brain? With the Institute of Isolation, I started to look more at the mind. If we are going to space, how do we condition our mind? Sure, we can train the body, but the mind is very unpredictable. The Institute of Isolation film is an observational, fictional documentary. It explores the design of physical experiences and interior space as a way to improve human performance; architecture and interior spaces designed to become tools to benefit humans. Can you tell me about the exhibition at NGV and how you're presenting these projects there? My work has never been exhibited under the one roof before \u2013 it's so exciting to move through 13 years of work. The show asks how technology is changing our bodies. It's five rooms with images of augmented bodies; music videos that take you on flights of biological fancy and an immersive algorithm that makes your face \"], \"images\": [\"full/136bbec050a4c1734133d4b8a0d5610c2a179549.jpg\", \"full/5eee2496380444e867feac1a4fc4ba687d50724c.jpg\", \"full/3827b08e3d8d948f75ba51d9fdbaf1fec17f073c.jpg\", \"full/e38a880bdb489fd9e99107b9c1a99a12dc358e7d.jpg\", \"full/702199778253e9f724501e471212f0d1a60792d5.jpg\", \"full/409f7e5bae5d408d0605867be25b7ee3f2944424.jpg\", \"full/f5ff8778cd124164c5a3afe67c1d01531536b800.jpg\", \"full/88e6ca1b0a4d83da8643ea3fd4fda5b8db4c264b.jpg\", \"full/b16ad3bc45300e74ac49b8ae136fbb04626978e2.jpg\"], \"title\": \"\\\"I'm interested in giving science fiction an overdue sex change\\\" says Lucy McRae\", \"image-tags\": [], \"text-tags\": []}, {\"text\": [\"The creative challenge was how to design a trophy celebrating sexuality without reiterating the cliched symbolism of erotica,\", \"I remembered a conversation I had years ago with Suze Randall about the vital importance of 'chemistry' in casting sex scenes \u2013 that thought led me to look into the science of erotic attraction.\", \"Principally I was interested to create a form that references the molecular structure of the main sex hormones including oestrogen and testosterone, but also some of the chemicals that come into play such as serotonin and dopamine,\", \"My intention was to maintain a degree of ambiguity in the final form the award took, with respect to the sexual spectrum so impressively encompassed by the award category line-up.\", \"Sculpturally the award has a bio-fluidity about it, abstractly evoking orifices, penetration, sperm and bondage toys...I think if you put several of them together they might actually reproduce!\", \"Kanye and I worked together some years ago and I think it's great that we have now both created a Pornhub Award,\"], \"images\": [\"full/806f7ef6faf2d313ac9a62391fa13f4a784d8551.jpg\", \"full/3e7c7b4b0c75605ea3e2fbc7451257af5a6202e9.jpg\"], \"title\": \"Peter Saville designs Pornhub Awards to celebrate sexuality without being a cliche\", \"image-tags\": [\"0\", \"1\"], \"text-tags\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\"]}, {\"text\": [\"Two years ago, at the turn of Alessi's centenary, the family started to look for a partner able to help us adapt to the new globalised world without losing our brand strength, spirit of research and design excellence,\", \"It was not easy, but with Oakley Capital we believe we have found just that partner.

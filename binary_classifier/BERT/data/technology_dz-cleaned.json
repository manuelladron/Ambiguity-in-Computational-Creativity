A body architect is something fabricated, a made-up name. But it won me a dream job in wearable electronics at Philips. I was put forward for a job where I would lead the company's design research lab. In the interview, the head of resources asked me what kind of designer I was. Medical designer? Fashion designer? Lighting designer? I moved my hands around in the air like I was juggling and said 'none of them'. He said, 'in order to hire you for this job, I need to know who you are'. So I went away and came up with this title 'body architect'. It's a nebulous term that allows me to slip between thought leader, creative director, science-fiction artist and filmmaker. I came back a week later to tell him and, no joke, he flipped the contract across the table. The following Monday I was rolling around in a Lycra sack, developing the kind of inspiration for what would become the Bubelle Dress. What exactly does a body architect do?  The great thing about creating something from scratch, is that you get to define what it means. As a body architect, I can tap into any discipline without limitation. I build worlds object by object to speculate on the future of the body; asking who we are and where we are headed. The worlds are presented via installation, film, photography and set design and address topics like the human condition, psychology, genetic engineering, edible technology or the ethics of artificial intelligence. My philosophy is to ask impossible questions, to disrupt, to swim upstream and to make things I've never made before. Why is the body so central to your work? I started doing classical ballet at the age of four and as I grew older I became much more serious about it. So as a teenager I was doing very high-level ballet competitions, training four days a week. Then, when I wasn't doing ballet, I was running 100-metre hurdles. Both disciplines were about performance and pushing my body's physical limits. Exploring the edges of the human body and proposing ways to optimise our existence, is what continually drives my work. Using my body allows me to go deeper into a concept and play the protagonist to act out worlds. I'm interested in the idea of thinking through making, either as a film director, or as the test dummy when I'm building an installation. Tell about the phrase you use, 'the future is fleshy'. Where did this come from and what does it mean in relation to your work? I was asked to speak at an MIT conference on wearable technology with Christina Agapakis, who is creative director at Gingko Bioworks, a company that customises the microbiome. 'The future is fleshy' was the title of our presentation, which shone a light on the lack of feminine points of view in science and tech. I'm not interested in a future that is associated with science-fiction tropes that are masculine, mechanical, or not reflective of what I think makes us human. I'm interested in things that are messy, visceral and human. This thinking relates to the body, both aesthetically and in how we could experience the world. As an artist, the way that I approach technology is using it like a membrane, an elastic visceral membrane that can be draped, pulled apart, made transparent or mutated. How male-dominated is the world of science, technology and science fiction in your experience, and how is that shaping our visions of the future? Traditionally art, architecture, engineering, science, maths, medicine, construction, law, agriculture... most industries are male-dominated. My goal is to portray females in these roles and summon feminine leadership. When I worked at Philips, I had a really amazing team who were predominantly male. Sometimes I would buy men's deodorant, and I would wear baseball caps and men's trousers, just to get into the headspace and the hormonal output of the rest of my team. I'm interested in giving science fiction an overdue sex change. The art I make speculates on the human condition with narratives that are feminine, raw and laced with emotion, to provoke and steer our future. Tell me about your time at Philips. What kind of things were you working on?  At Philips we used the body as a platform for innovation to question the future of tech and the body. We weren't interested in technologies that were intelligent, we were interested in technologies that were sensitive. We created a series of dresses that blushed and shivered with light, jewellery that sensed hydration and an electronic tattoo that was augmented by touch. These were high-art concepts for a consumer electronics company. We were trying to understand whether people wanted this. Would people implant tech under the skin? Would they wear a dress that senses emotions? The concepts were meant to be disruptive and provocative. Was the series of images you made with Bart Hess an extension of these ideas? The series I made with Bart, in particular the Germination series, explores the concept of humans, plants and animals merging. Could we sprout grass from the pores of skin and become ecological beings? Bart and I met at Philips doing the electronic tattoo. At the time, plastic surgery was becoming a consumer product. So we were having conversations about the future of beauty. What is the future of beauty? If everyone is going to look the same, will this create a mono aesthetic? Will that cause a rebellion of the ugly? The important thing for us was that we made immediate imagery for these conversations. We would do them in a day, we would do them once a week, and it became a sport using various different materials. It would be an experiment and it was really primal. How did you move from these projects to the type of speculative futures things you did next, like Swallowable Parfum?  The very foundation of looking at technology through an artistic lens was what I learned at Philips. It was such an incredible lesson, to see technology as something you could give a story to. After I left, I had four and a half years of experience in wearable tech and I had this project with Bart, but nobody really knew how to use me. Swallowable Parfum was me saying, 'this is what I can do, this is how you can use me'. It was 2011 and at the time the beauty industry was worth $465 billion in the US alone; perfume had never been disrupted. While animals sniff butts to find breeding companions, humans wear deodorant, perfume and take hormone replacement pills that all mask body odour. When we sweat, it's the smell of our immune system oxidizing through our skin. The concept of the pill was to manipulate the immune system to create a biologically enhanced fragrance from the inside out. Could a biologically enhanced fragrance be responsible for disrupting the laws of attraction? Would we choose different partners to breed with? Could the beauty industry be responsible for changing the course of evolution? Do you see your projects as trying to ask questions or answer them? Definitely to ask them. I'm not interested in saying how things will be or how they should be. I want to ask, what if this happened? The aim is to ask impossible questions to provoke the body's relationship with science and create forums for debate. I want the complexity of where we are right now to reach the fringes of culture. We've been submissive to technology \u2013 it drips into our lives and we just adapt. It's important to challenge whether we really want it. What I learned with Swallowable Parfum is that, if you tell plausible stories about the future, people will want these narratives to be real. And that can steer the course of technology. After that it seems like you moved on from beauty into thinking about the relationship between the body and space. Can you tell me about some of those projects? I have to say, the project I did with Dezeen was pivotal. It was the installation I did \u2013 up until that point, I had been making short films. After that, I created the first Future Day Spa at the Ricoh conference in Los Angeles. The Future Day Spa is an immersive art installation offering 360-degree hugs via a machine. When the body is placed in a vacuum, the circulation of blood increases. In the 1960s, NASA used vacuum pressure as a way to prep astronauts for the lack of gravity in space. Like a human hug, this hugging machine triggers the natural release of oxytocin in the brain. This hormone is responsible for building trust and love between people. One of the people I treated at the Future Day Spa suffered from haphephobia, which is the fear of physical contact. I gave him a nine-minute treatment and when he got up out of the bed, he hugged me. It wasn't what I had expected! After learning that someone who feared touch craved for it, I threw my attention into the psychology of isolation. Why would someone essentially silence the release of oxytocin in the brain? With the Institute of Isolation, I started to look more at the mind. If we are going to space, how do we condition our mind? Sure, we can train the body, but the mind is very unpredictable. The Institute of Isolation film is an observational, fictional documentary. It explores the design of physical experiences and interior space as a way to improve human performance; architecture and interior spaces designed to become tools to benefit humans. Can you tell me about the exhibition at NGV and how you're presenting these projects there? My work has never been exhibited under the one roof before \u2013 it's so exciting to move through 13 years of work. The show asks how technology is changing our bodies. It's five rooms with images of augmented bodies; music videos that take you on flights of biological fancy and an immersive algorithm that makes your face \"], \"images\":

Each of the five spaces in the exhibition focused on a different type of experience and application of sensory technology, to create subtle forms of audio, visual and tactile communication. The first, called Echo, featured two rows of square columns that contained movement sensors. When visitors passed between and around the columns, they created sounds in response to individual movements. The second space was called Under The Light. It contained four experiments focused on light and shadow, with wall lights that changed in response to movement detected by different sensor arrays to create various effects \u2013 including the sellotaped piece of paper that looked like it was moving. \", \" Tako explained to Dezeen. \", \" \", \" he said. \", \" The third space was called Tactile Objects. It focused on touch and sight, with objects placed on tables under hood-like structures that contain sensor units to enable different responses. Examples included a sound system controlled by three geometric, stone-like objects, which changed the type of music, the volume and the tone when moved. There was also a jug that contained no liquid but felt and sounded like it was pouring water when picked up and tipped. The fourth space, titled Abstract Electronics, included six playful projects, including a room-divider made from glass panes that pivoted and became transparent or opaque as they turned, muting the scene behind. It also included a shelf unit with a back that could change from a marble-effect to a wood effect based on a material sample being placed on one of its shelves. The back of this unit was a super-thin screen. A rectangular picture frame could be placed anywhere on this surface to create a screen-within-a-screen, showing a moving image in contrast to the marble or wood-effect around it. When the frame was removed, the image disappeared, and it would reappear wherever the screen was placed. The final space was called Day and Night. It was styled like a home interior, with a series of vignettes that each demonstrated a different application of the technologies shown earlier in the exhibition within a more familiar environment. Among them were picture frames where the image zoomed as a person approached, a corridor where the light moved with you, a wall clock that changed time zones in response to the turning of a block on a desk below, a plant that told you the weather forecast, a paper photo album that controlled a wall display of photographs as the pages were turned, a TV and picture wall controlled by a geometric object, and a table where pools of light appeared as each individual sits down, creating personalised reading and dining spots. Also included in this space was a series of small, everyday objects that had been turned into interfaces to create mood lighting and effects, including a candleholder that created a localised, glowing light when a hand was passed over it or it was pointed at.

PND Wearable is a brain-scanning technology. It is very slim and you wear it. At its core it's a brain-scanning device.  What stage of development are you at with this and when will it be available on the market?  We\u2019re still prototyping the wearable. The technology has actually been around for about 100 years, but because of computing we can scale it a lot smaller than it has been and mass-produce it. We\u2019re probably about a year away from actual consumer production.  How long did you say the technology PND Wearable uses has been around for?  It's about 100-120 years or something like that. It is something called Electroencephalography (EEG). Have you ever seen Back To The Future? Doc Brown wears that giant cap and tries to read Marty McFly's mind \u2013 that's the technology we're working with. Everything we know about sleep such as delta sleep, REM sleep and certain brain problems such as bipolar disorder have been learned through this technology over the last hundred years or so.  Could you explain how PND Wearable uses EEG technology to read a user's brain?  The nerves in your brain produce electrical activity and that's how they transfer information through your brain. A little bit of that electrical activity leaks out of each cell. On a large scale throughout your entire brain there's enough electricity that leaks out to be picked up by a sensor that is placed on your forehead. The pattern of electrical activity that emerges as your brain works is indicative of what is happening in your brain. From that we can tell things like if you're stressed, or if you're relaxed; if you\u2019re meditating; if you have bipolar disorder or anxiety disorder; if you're going to have a seizure \u2013 things like that.  Once the device has read your brain and understood that your stress levels are high for example, what can the PND Wearable technology do for its wearer?  We have several apps that do different things. In the case of stress, we don't actually have a stress management tool per se right now, but we're working on one that would monitor your stress level. If it passes a critical threshold, it warns you and says, 'Hey, you need to relax'. That's how that would work.  How can PND Wearable help people who have suffered brain injuries?  It pairs with an app on your phone. The app that we are building at the moment is called Mind Bender, which is based on cognitive research around brain trauma. There are certain conditions caused by traumatic brain injury such as concentration levels, retention of memory, being present or focused as well as conscious of what's going on. You can wear the PND Wearable, which monitors your brain and sends that data to the mobile app. This app analyses the data coming off your brain and figures out how well you are concentrating. It can present this data live on a screen so that you can start to feel the association between when you're concentrating effectively, and when you're not. It can generate a report after you've done each exercise to give feedback about where you're strengths and weaknesses are within that exercise, and if you are improving over time. It's kind of like a personal trainer that benchmarks your progress.   . What are your views on that?  I think it was an extreme case. About ten years ago I used to have a PalmPilot. It was before smartphones were popular and before people had cell phones. I loved it. It held my contacts, it scheduled my appointments \u2013 it did everything. I used to call it my backup brain. I really relied on it to get around. People who didn't have one would say, 'Oh you're just a douchebag with a PalmPilot, what do you need that thing for? It's stupid'. There was a resistance to the new technology. But then, when smartphones became useable and had good quality apps and good data connections, suddenly everybody had a smartphone. They became ubiquitous. Now people with smartphones make fun of somebody who has a flip-phone. I think that Google Glass or a similar technology will go through the same. It's really weird and literally in your face to be wearing a pair of glasses that are a computer, but as the utility and the value proposition of that technology goes up and people become accustomed to finding ways to use it, the cultural shift will happen from 'Oh that douchebag is wearing Google Glass', to 'Oh that douchebag has an old version of Google Glass.'  Could social media be an application for this technology?  There was a wristband that came out for a while that they gave to stock traders in New York. It measured their stress levels. It was useful to the stock traders to know when they were stressed as the quality of their decision-making went down when they were stressed, but because they were also very macho, showy people, they didn't want to show weakness. Stress is perceived as a form of weakness so they didn't want to wear it in public. They would wear it at home when they were working, but they didn't want to wear it in public because it would alert other people to the fact that they were stressed and aware of that stress, or concerned about being stressed. I think there are a lot of social taboos in our society about mental illness and emotional vulnerability. People will not want to divulge this, especially with people they don\u2019t trust or know. So the social aspect of what's happening in your mind will probably be limited to a select few friends and family, or caretakers.  But it is conceivable that this kind of technology could understand what is going on in your mind, translate and communicate it to social media?  Yes. In a way it's like a reality check. Let's say that you have anxiety disorder and you're prone to having anxiety attacks. Typically people who are having an anxiety attack have difficulty being rational during the time they are having the anxiety attack. If you have this thing that reads your mind and says, 'Hey, just so you know, it's time to relax a little bit', it provides that reality check for somebody who would otherwise go off the rails. That's an extreme example. But maybe in the future it will be possible to measure if somebody is sad or excited or something.

One of the most high-profile cases surrounding the legality and ethics of DNA ownership was the example of Henrietta Lacks. While receiving treatment for cancer of the cervix in 1951, she had a healthy part of the tissue removed without permission. The cells were later grown in vitro and have since been used by pharmaceutical companies to develop polio vaccines and in the research of AIDS, cancer and radiation poisoning. The material is still used today and is referred to as hela cells in reference to the first two letters of her first and last name. More recently, a court case in 1990 between John Moore, a US citizen undergoing treatment for hairy cell leukaemia and the UCLA Medical Center brought the issue back into the headlines. \", \" said Barcia-Colombo. \", \" A second version of the art project is due to go on display in New York this summer. Below is an edited transcript of the interview with Barcia-Colombo:  How did you develop the idea of the vending machine?  I'm very interested in the idea of law generally when it comes to ownership of DNA, and I like to express that in a playful way. But it's really about questions of privacy. We have huge pharmaceutical companies making loads of money out of DNA from people who haven't necessarily given them permission to use their DNA. That kind of thing really fascinates me.  What is the piece about?  The piece is about privacy and DNA ownership. With the DNA Vending Machine I hope to draw attention to historical cases of DNA ownership or commercialised human cells as in the cases of Henrietta Lacks and the supreme court decision in Moore v. Regents of the University of California, where in the early 1990's the court ruled that a person's discarded tissue and cells are not their property and can be commercialised. This is not a celebration of any of these verdicts or laws but rather a reminder of our complicated past when it comes to ownership over genetic material. In the future, when everyone has access to cheaper biotechnology, DNA may be much more valuable than a candy bar, soda or some other treat sold in a vending machine.  What have been the responses to the vending machine?  On approaching it, they don't know what it is. Then they read about it on a little placard and are pretty grossed out by it. They're disgusted that this is using human genetic material, and they often are scared by it. They're scared because the samples can be bought and used to plant evidence on a crime scene. It's DNA from inside our cheek cells which is very readily available, but in this context it's elevated to a more artistic context, but also, in another way, it makes it more human.  Who are the samples of?  Mostly friends. I started doing it at parties. I'd have people over at my house and say hey, \", \" and show them how it worked. I work at NYU and asked if there were any students who would be interested in it outside NYU, and then I worked with a bio-tech lab in Brooklyn called Genspace, and we did some DNA extractions there. So I started with friends and then expanded.\"], \"images\": [\"full/08e7497ad2f43bf187dc53b27ddcdf88ae1b5d48.jpg\", \"full/75043a8caeaea18e1f01ce9980fdeaeebb0b292a.jpg\"], \"title\": \"Genetic engineering will be \\\"as accessible as 3D-printing\\\" says DNA Vending Machine designer\"}, {\"text\": [\"I wanted to make the best possible disease-detection instrument that we could almost distribute for free,\", \"What came out of this project is what we call use-and-throw microscopy.\", \"These are literally built out of paper, tape and glue, and they are as good as research microscopes that you can buy,\"], \"images\": [\"full/04f815035bb52cf359d7a172dc414e56a8d14964.jpg\", \"full/8ee46ab0d9d3b40c028c2c889de470ec96e51d95.jpg\", \"full/72ce86d75e27de42d4c942ffbc7a0713b9bba14b.jpg\", \"full/40a72b305d7ce323b4494997e0c8a6ea6fa75d3b.jpg\", \"full/69ab42ac061b0597ff63566c9118f48b1d03f15d.jpg\"], \"title\": \"Disposable paper microscope developed for detecting malaria\"}, {\"text\": [\"needs to be updated\", \"Everything is moving so fast and you can do so many things now with technology,\", \"But we're still interacting with it as if it was 50 years ago.

It's a website where people post ideas of things they want to do, or make, or create and other people support them. Generally these ideas will only happen with the support of others; they're the proposals. Each project has its own community with people coming together to make a restaurant, a movie, a game, a product, a theatre production - things like that. It's this huge creative universe.  How did it start?  The idea came from my partner Perry Chen in 2002. He was living in New Orleans trying to put on a concert during Jazz Fest. He wanted to bring Kruder & Dorfmeister to come play and he couldn't make it happen. But he came up with the idea to propose the concert to the public, which people could support it if they wanted to, but where they would only be charged money if a critical mass of people decided it was worth doing. He was really struck by that idea but at the time he was working as a waiter, as a teacher, as a pre-recording engineer and just like hanging out in New Orleans. In 2005 he moved back to New York where he's from, with intention of really getting this going. Two months after he moved back, we met at a restaurant in Brooklyn where he was waiting tables. At the time I was a music critic and a highly mediocre journalist. He told me about his idea and we began working on it together. About a year and a half later I met Charles Adler, who's a designer, and the idea began to take on a better shape. Then in April 2009, the site finally launched; at 4:27pm it went live. This week is our fifth birthday. The growth has always been grassroots, just people telling each other. They send an email to their friends and some of their friends back them and it's been entirely the way it's grown for five years.  What was the first product that got funded on Kickstarter?  The first product design project on Kickstarter was called the Glif. It was launched in September 2010 by two amateur designers named Dan and Tom and it was an iPhone 4 tripod stand. When they first reached out to us, we were actually really confused because it didn't really seem like a Kickstarter project. But it ended up doing very well. They were seeking $10,000 and they ended up raising like $160,000 and that really kicked off this huge wave. I think the world of product design and manufacturing was completely different after that. That was the moment of massive growth and it became something else entirely.  How has Kickstarter changed the way designers bring products to market?  I think the first thing it's done is it's considerably widened the funnel of what is viable in terms of units. Viability used to lie at one million plus units, 100,000 plus units. Now it can be 50. I think that significantly changes what's possible. I think the other things it does is allows people to create designs that solve very specific problems and hopefully not in a TV informercial kind of way, but in a way that also encompasses a sense of aesthetic and beauty as an object. I guess it's the same promise that gets people excited about 3D printing: that we're all capable of producing whatever object we might desire. When you expand a tool beyond where pure experts might want to use it and just make it really generally available, there's just a lot of weird, wonderful, unanticipated s**t that happens and that's always good. Any time it starts to veer into areas of total unpredictability are pretty exciting and ignorance and naivety are some of the greatest assets you can have when it comes to creating anything.  Does Kickstarter encourage people who otherwise wouldn't be designers?  One of the things I've been really fascinated by is the slim-wallet category. It's a thing that people make fun of: there are like 500 at any given time. We decided to look into it a little bit and what we are discovering is that the slim wallet is actually the perfect training wheel for designing products: you learn the supply chain, you learn how to work with the manufacturer and how to design, but it's relatively low risk. You just have to work with fabric, you don't have to work with any hard materials and there's only so many ways you can f**k it up basically. But it's that first practice shot of getting a sense of what it's like to be able to produce something at a scale greater than what you can make on your own. So it's introducing a lot of first-time folks who never thought about product design. They're starting with the slim wallet, then jumping into something else entirely. I have to think that's a good thing and I think having a greater appreciation for where things come from is a good thing.  So it's educating a whole generation of people about how stuff gets made.  There's this lie about the the global supply chain where we seem to think that iPhones grow on trees and magically fall into boxes; where Amazon ship it 24 hours later and it's this magical, painless process. What you don't see are all the hours of work that went into it, the human hands creating those sorts of things, the many authors who not only created those process but the whole supply chain. I think it's almost to society's detriment that that's been hidden, because then we don't see the cost of it. We don't understand those things because it just seems so f**king easy. So experiencing that pain and experiencing what it is to make something, a greater understanding of that, I have to believe that in the long term that makes us a more astute and more sophisticated world.  How do you ensure that products on Kickstarter are viable ideas, and not fantasies?  We instituted rules about a year and half ago called \", \" and there are two chief rules. One was that we prohibited the use of photo realistic rendering and product simulations. I talked to a lot of industrial designers leading up to that - very prominent people - and I talked to them about this idea and I got a fair amount of push back. They said photo realistic renderings are all we use; every print ad in a magazine is a rendering, it's never a physical object. I was like, \", \" That seems kind of f**ked up. The typical image of the perfect object on a white background is not very realistic and is selling a certain concept of design that is fairly far from the real world and we very actively try to change that. We encourage designers to show the prototype, show the ugly version made on  . That's the real s**t and I think that there is an audience for that now that truly understands the nature of design. You can show these early rough versions and you get credibility because you're being real.  Is there anything that ideas that do well on Kickstarter have in common?  The only thing on the Kickstarter page that really matters is the storytelling, meaning like you could put up the   [Kickstarter's most successful project, which raised $10 million] with a really s**tty video that was really uninteresting and it wouldn't have done anything. I think Eric [Migicovsky, who came up with the Pebble smart watch concept] did a great job of telling that story and framing it. Things that are beautiful and clever will get repeated by a lot of people and will get in front of eyeballs. I don't think that anyone is any more pro than anyone else or that sort of stuff. An amateur and a seasoned vet can have equal success, especially in product design, and I think that's less about the creator and more about the product itself. So it's kind of unpredictable.  How has Kickstarter shifted the balance of power between big brands and individual designers?  A big brand is going to go through who knows how many f**king meetings to decide if something's a priority and then they have more meetings and so many iterations and it's got to be like years since the initial idea and the world does not work in years anymore. Time is now barely days at this point, time is measured in tweets. It's f**king scary. So I think there's a way that big brands are at a disadvantage. They can throw money at anything but from a creativity standpoint, an individual designer or a small team is in a far better position. But what you see is that Eric comes up with Pebble, then apparently Apple is going to copy it or something. That's what all the Apple rumour blogs are saying. It's interesting when someone creates the idea and someone like Apple then builds off it, makes it fifty times as big. Do we view that as success or failure or what? I have no idea. The other thing is that I like knowing that my Pebble is made by a guy named Eric and that sense of origin. The mass-manufacture churn of the big brand is obviously something that can hit one million shelves at once and can be an item selling on Amazon or whatever, but I think for an increasing number of consumers they're looking for experiences on a different level. I think it's more interesting because they can have a closer tie and know what's up and to have a story. I see Pebbles on people's wrists pretty frequently and I'll sometimes ask them about it and they say it's something to brag about. It's not just a watch but it's like \"], \"images\": [\"full/74f78b08bad586cb4634fa3225f9031bc28f41d8.jpg\", \"full/f160e7863327f7c3119fa325d69795a37bcad2fe.jpg\", \"full/588caca9014cd8d2f496b1c86bceda8b0b5b2615.jpg\", \"full/72172dd5135090e7ab9da93bfb10a37b79c30f4f.jpg\", \"full/eb0776b35cf7a2b0166f721936de1003cb0bf630.jpg\", \"full/6e0dec7a22c928cff64932b425e9e2bf11c34cdf.jpg\", \"full/a73f9be19c3dd401d27b9092e295d57df2532f53.jpg\", \"full/89f67e855fc9e6da70131ddddfc5b2dc3aab143a.jpg\", \"full/5be1d572935689d57e7e3c77cf9e3395a514571d.jpg\", \"full/954265e33a6fe932874852559ba8b89e064bf621.jpg\"], \"title\": \"Kickstarter means that \\\"big brands are at a disadvantage\\\"\"}, {\"text\": [\"It's our first collection of new frames,\", \"We're finally at the beginning point of letting people wear what they want to wear [when using Glass].\", \"This is the next step in the evolution of our design and truly gives wearers the opportunity to make Glass one\u2019s own,\", \"This announcement also allows us to serve a new demographic (people with glasses) and starts a new area of the eyewear industry, 'smart eyewear'.\", \"The frames are accessories,\", \"You detach the really expensive and complex technology from the style part.

In On Such a Full Sea, Lee has turned his acute eye toward the future of America. The story takes place in a chilling dystopia, a century or so beyond the present, where abandoned post-industrial cities like Baltimore have been converted into forced labor colonies and populated with immigrant workers. China is a distant, mythical memory. Environmental catastrophes have laid waste to much of the world, a cancer-like disease has infected the entire population, and stratification by class and race is more pronounced and horrific than ever. The fate of the world may lay in the hands of one tiny, nervy girl named Fan, an enigmatic and beautiful fish-tank diver who jolts the labor colony by running away. Epic in scope, masterful in execution, and page-turning right to the shocking end, On Such a Full Sea fires on many levels: it is simultaneously a heart-stopping survival adventure across the wasteland of a wrecked continent; a deeply moving story of a girl's first love; and a searing, frightening commentary on where America may be headed if we don't strive to do better. The Boston Globe writes that Lee \", \" On Such a Full Sea imagines a future in which that question is more urgent than ever, and challenges us to ask what we need to change today.

So you'd be able to use cells of the person that is ill and create specific micro-tissues that would replicate their response, rather than the response of a generic human. Image of animal testing courtesy of  . Here's an edited transcript of the interview with Faulkner-Jones:  Tell us who you are and what this project is all about.  I'm Alan Faulkner-Jones from Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh and we're working on this bio-printer to produce small human micro-tissues for drug testing and drug production to replace animal testing.  There's been a lot of talk about 3D printing of human tissue. How much further forward does this project take the story?  This is a major breakthrough in the fact that we did more testing than has ever been done before on the exact physiological response of the stem cells to the printing process. A lot of people have tried to do it before and have just checked whether or not they're still alive at the end of the process, but we checked several markers to make sure that they were still physiologically the same cells at the end as they were when they went in. So we checked the potency markers to check the stem cells were still stem cells - because if they're not stem cells then the technology isn't worth anything, because you've changed them by printing. We want it to be as non invasive as possible. So on top of the fact that we've been able to prove that it's over 90% viable, the cells are physiologically identical when they come out of the printing process.  How much does this have in common with a standard 3D printer such as a MakerBot?  All the iterations of our technology started out as something else. The first generation model was a CNC machine, which was too big. We couldn't do anything with it. So we made a series of these - this is the third one - and you might notice that some of the plastic bits are from a MakerBot.  It's hacked?  Yeah. We rebuilt it. It has a completely new control system and everything but the plastic bits and the rails came off a Replicator 1. But the major difference of course is the print head, which is a completely different design. It's a pressurised cartridge system which is fed into a solenoid valve with a nozzle on it. By opening and closing the valve, we can produce different volumes of fluid. And by changing the pressure and the opening time we can control the different size of droplet we produce.  So it's a pneumatic process rather than an extrusion process?  Yes. The fluid is under pressure.  Is this specifically aimed at the drug testing market?  I'm aiming it at testing. My supervisor and some of the researchers aren't exactly geared towards it but it lends itself strongly to replace animal testing.  Tell us how that would work, and how soon it could be ready.  At the moment unfortunately a lot of drugs have to be tested on animals for regulations. You have to prove that it works, which unfortunately leads to the drugs being tailored to the specific animals they're tested on, which won't give you an accurate response for a human. Which is why a lot of money is spent on drugs that don't make it to market.  They work for rabbits but they don't work for people?  Exactly. So they fail at the last hurdle basically. You've spent so long testing them on animals that they don't work on humans. Or if they do they produce adverse side effects. So the idea is that we would produce micro-tissues of specific organs in the body and then they would have the same reaction to the physiological environment - drugs, everything - as the entire organ would do, but on a much smaller scale. So you can apply the drug to the micro-tissue and it would give off the same result. So if it killed it or inflamed it, you'd get that response. And you could then connect a series of these micro-organs together into a system that is becoming known as \"], \"images\": [\"full/3ecd708f40ba9cac2dd58f48a34c6a70ae1d51d1.jpg\", \"full/b892ca3d06d0d0f882914deea89f50305fbf1b26.jpg\", \"full/f67fdb3bc3dfe58bea63243e9b023471ad16450f.jpg\"], \"title\": \"3D-printed human cells could \\\"replace animal testing\\\"\"}, {\"text\": [\"functions beautifully and has already handled 50 rounds of successful firing.\", \"We're proving this is possible,\", \"The technology is at a place now where we can manufacture a gun with 3D Metal Printing.\", \"The whole concept of using a laser sintering process to 3D-print a metal gun revolves around proving the reliability, accuracy and usability of metal 3D printing as functional prototypes and end use products,\", \"It's a common misconception that 3D Printing isn't accurate or strong enough, and we're working to change people's perspective.\", \"We're doing this legally,\", \"In fact, as far as we know, we're the only 3D Printing Service Provider with a Federal Firearms License (FFL).

Roberto Bolle, etoile dancer at La Scala in Milan and Principal Dancer with the American Ballet Theatre, along with Italian director and choreographer Marco Pelle, inspired the gestures of the robots. Roberto Bolle's movements were filmed and used as input for the programming of the Makr Shakr robots.

Is Tuli just another techno-determinist who\u2019s imbibed too much of the Silicone Valley Kool-Aid? Worse, is the social agenda a convenient cover for what is ultimately an entrepreneurial venture? Now that I come to think of it, how does he make these tablets so cheap in the first place? The Kindle Fire sells at \u00a3129, which is \u00a330 less than it costs to manufacture - money   can afford to lose because what it's really selling is not hardware but content. Yes, Tuli cut out the unnecessary ports and features, and he negotiated a good deal on the touchscreens (the most expensive part of any tablet) but the Aakash still seems to do most of what an iPad can do, so there is presumably some very cheap labour going on that he has failed to mention. Let's put that aside for now, along with any qualms about the environmental impact of a billion tablets, which Tuli calls \", \" in comparison to battling illiteracy and ignorance (which I think he may be right about). Looking at the big picture, we see a massive emerging market for devices that will connect people to the knowledge resource that is the internet. India, where 800 million people use cell phones but can\u2019t go online, is such a market. In 2011 Indians bought 250,000 tablets (mainly Apple and Samsung). The following year it was more than 3 million (mainly Aakash). In fact, Datawind fell far short of being able to keep up with demand.  and   may not have time for this market but they should be worried by it, because Indians are not the only ones interested in a \u00a340 tablet. In fact, Tuli was swamped after his lecture. It's customary at these things for a few keen audience members to mill around with an extra-time question, but this was fully half the lecture theatre. People were crowding round for a glimpse of this gadget. It was not their social consciences that drove them forward but pure consumer instinct. The air was heavy with musk. Soon, Canadians will be able to buy an Ubislate for 37 Canadian dollars. If it's \", \" for them, then companies like Apple and Samsung will have to change their game rather fast. It will also suggest that India is now the place to look for disruptive innovation. The warning signs are already here. Last week Microsoft bought back \u00a324 billion of its own shares. Earlier this year, Apple bought back \u00a362 billion of shares. Instead of investing their cash in research, they're giving it away to their shareholders. That, according to business thinkers like  , is the beginning of the end.

We've reported on a number of projects involving 3D printing recently, including   and news that  . Here's some more information from Unfold: Unfold is pleased to announce its participation in the inaugural Istanbul Design Biennial. The Biennial opened on October 13 and will run till December 12. Joseph Grima, curator of the Adhocracy exhibition, invited Unfold to present Kiosk 2.0 and commissioned a new project featuring Unfold's continuing work on ceramic 3D printing and its implications on design and manufacturing: Stratigraphic Manufactury. In Stratigraphic Manufactury, Unfold builds on its Stratigraphic Porcelain series started in 2010 with its internationally acclaimed installation l'Artisan Electronique and explores methods of manufacturing and distributing design in the dawning era of digital production. Stratigraphic Manufactury is a new model for the distribution and digital manufacturing of porcelain, which includes local small manufacturing units that are globally connected. One that embraces local production variations and influences. A set of digital 3D files of designs presented last spring in Milan by Unfold has been e-mailed to various manufacturers around the world who have acquired the 3d printing production method that Unfold pioneered and open sourced in 2009. They were instructed not to alter the digital files but were free to incorporate personal and local influences and interpretations during the production. These new sets will be presented in Adhocracy in the context of a local manufacturing shop. In collaboration with Turkish ceramists, a manufacturing unit will become operational for the duration of the Istanbul Design Biennial: Stratigraphic Manufactury Istanbul, estd. 2012.

Tell us about that adventure and what\u2019s happened to you and what\u2019s happened to 3D printing in the last nine years.\u201d  \u201cWhen I started everything was very, very expensive so it was very difficult to get the whole thing going. My dream was always to start an industry instead of designing individual products. So I think the first five, six, seven years were extremely difficult both financially and in terms of having people believe in the vision. Only in the last three years things have exponentially started moving forward to an industry that I always envisioned. And especially the last year. It\u2019s going great.\u201d  \u201cAnd why has it suddenly taken off in the last two or three years?\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s some [3D printing] patents that have run out and of course there's now massive awareness towards the whole story; and to be honest the pricing. You can [print] normal household products, like this iPod Nano holder for example, which costs two Euros to make. So why go buy something when you could just make your own things?\u201d  \u201cYou mentioned patents expiring. So companies that had the patents for these manufacturing technologies were preventing it from being widely taken up?\u201d  \u201cThat happens in any technology. Once restrictions are removed, the bigger crowd starts to flourish.\u201d  \u201cFreedom Of Creation is now owned by 3D Systems. Tell us about that merger, that takeover, and tell us about the company you now work for.\u201d  \u201cThat happened about a year and a half ago. We've been talking for a number of years about how I always envisioned that the consumer world would be the final frontier for this type of adventure. They had something that I needed: technology, software, finance and a whole bunch of people running in the same direction. I had of course 12 years of valuable content that we can just quickly get going, instead of them getting other designers or buying somewhere else to get it going. So it was for me a match made in heaven.\u201d  \u201cAnd they\u2019re a company that makes 3D printing machines?\u201d  \u201cYeah. 3D Systems originally started 25 years ago, so it actually invented the whole technology and the whole industry.
